<h1>Jucy.ini file</h1>
Some advanced settings are available only from the Jucy.ini file. Which should be located next to your executable.
 
<h3>Portable jucy</h3>

Some people like to carry around their programs with an USB stick. So they can use them everywhere.
With jucy this not as easy as jucy stores all data in the user folder by default and not with the program.
But this this can be changed in the jucy.ini file.
This file has some basic parameters that change jucy's behaviour.
<p><p>
It should contain something like: <br>
-data
@user.home/UC
-vmargs
-Xmx256m
<p><p>

"-data @user.home/UC"  stands for using the UC subdirectory of the user's home directory. To make jucy use the program 
folder for storing userdata one can just delete the whole data parameter. Or for example if multiple users should use 
the same settings "@user.home/UC"  can be replaced with a path that all users can access. i.e. a shared Folder like 
"C:\Users\Public\UC" or "/some/place/.UC".  <p><p> 


<h3>Memory Settings</h3>
All after -vmargs  is arguments for the java virtual machine. There is currently only "-Xmx512m" which tells Java to 
allow jucy to use up to 512 MiB of RAM. Better don't change this. Fewer might result in errors, more would just be lost RAM.
But for very large shares setting the ram higher can save you from running out of memory.

<p><p> 
<h3>Different languages</h3>
Jucy comes bundled with a few languages (If you want to add another and are willing to do the translation 
come to  <a href="http://jucy.eu">the forum</a> ).
Usually language is choosen according to OS settings. Though you can override this by adding a "-nl en" parameter before -vmargs.
Where "en" stands for English ("de" for German, "ru" for Russian, ...).  

<h3>Running headless</h3>
if you want Jucy to run without a gui. This may be useful for example on a server without a graphic system or where you 
just don't want any gui. Add -nogui  and -nosplash  to the ini file and Jucy will start as always just without a gui. 
Be aware that thsi is totally useless without Fav hubs set on auto start as you won't be able to do any settings/connect manually.
